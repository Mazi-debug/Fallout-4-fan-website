    <h2>
      A beginner-friendly fan site exploring the world, lore, factions, and
      characters of Fallout 4.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Fallout 4 is a post-apocalyptic role-playing game developed by Bethesda
      Game Studios and set in the ruins of the Commonwealth, a region that was
      once the city of Boston. Two hundred years after a nuclear war, society
      has collapsed into scattered settlements, hostile factions, and dangerous
      wastelands. This website is a personal fan project designed to help new
      players understand the game’s world, its major groups, and the story
      behind the ruins. No prior Fallout knowledge is required.
