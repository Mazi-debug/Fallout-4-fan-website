    <h2>A World After Nuclear War</h2>
    <p>
      In the Fallout universe, nuclear war broke out in the year 2077,
      destroying most of human civilization in a matter of hours. The survivors
      either hid in underground vaults or struggled to live on the surface. Two
      hundred years later, the world has not fully recovered. Technology exists
      alongside extreme poverty, and morality is shaped by survival rather than
      law. Vaults and Experiments Vaults were built by the Vault-Tec Corporation
      and were advertised as safe shelters. However, many vaults were secretly
      designed to run social and scientific experiments on their inhabitants.
      Vault 111, where the player begins, was intended to test long-term
      cryogenic freezing on humans.
